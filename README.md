# Inline stickers search bot
This bot will help you find your stickers in inline mode. At first, you should provide descriptions for every sticker you want to add to search results.

Stickers are separated into _sticker sets_. By default, they are kept in a default sticker set, unique for every user.

You can share all your sticker sets except for the default set with other users by sending them the link to add your sticker set.

To search for a sticker in any Telegram chat, just type the bot username in the message input field and start typing your query. Sticker suggestions will appear above if there are any. This bot can handle tiny typos and wrong keyboard layout (Rus/Eng).
