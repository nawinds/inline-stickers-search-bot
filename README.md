# Inline stickers search bot
This bot will help you find your stickers in inline mode. 
At first you should provide descriptions for every 
sticker you want to add to search results.

Stickers are separated into _sticker sets_. By default, 
they are kept in a default sticker set, 
unique for every user.

You can share all your sticker sets except for the 
default set with other users by sending them the 
link to add your sticker set.

To search for a sticker in any Telegram chat, 
just type the bot username in the message input 
field and start typing your query. 
Sticker suggestions will appear above if there are any.

_If you have any questions or suggestions, 
feel free to contact [@nawinds](https://t.me/nawinds)!_
